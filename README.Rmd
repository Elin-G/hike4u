# `hike4u`

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

`hike4u` is an `R` package to plot the closest hiking route near you. It uses exclusively open source data: hiking route data from *OpenStreetMap* and basemaps from *OpenStreetMap* and *Esri*. By defining your location through **longitude** and **latitude**, and adding a buffer size, you can retrieve hiking routes from the local walking network of *OSM*. By defining a closeness value, you can plot not only the closest hiking route to your location, but also the second closest, third closest, and so on. Your chosen route is ultimately plotted as an overview map or a satellite map. The first can be used to orient oneself, the second to see which kind of terrain is covered by the route. These two maps are exported to your working directory as `png` files. The package aims to ease the discovery of hiking routes close-by, to encourage exploring new areas, as well as to provide a tool for planning hiking trips.




## Installation


You can install the released version of `hike4u` from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Elin-G/hike4u")
```




## Example

This example shows how easy it is to plot the closest hiking route near you.

Run the function `get_number_routes` to get an overview of how many hiking routes are available in your selected buffer area.

**Example code:**
``` r
library(hike4u)

# Define your location with long=9.93389691622025 and lat=49.79895823510417, and define the buffer as 10000 meters (10 km)

get_number_routes(9.93389691622025, 49.79895823510417, 10000)
```

**Running this example will print the following text in your console:**

A simple way to get the coordinates for a location you need is to use Google Maps. Right-click on the location and copy and paste them into the `hike4u_ov` function to generate an overview map, or into the `hike4u_sat` function to generate a satellite map.

A good buffer size to start with is 10000 meters. Do not choose a buffer size that is too small, as there might not be any hiking routes in that area. Additionally do not choose a buffer size that is too large, as the function will take longer to run, or your device might not be able to handle the request.

Set the closeness value to 1 for the closest hike to your location. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can increase the closeness value to 2, 3, [...]. The function will then plot the second closest hiking route, the third closest hiking route, and so on.


**Example code:**
``` r
library(hike4u)

# Define your location with long=9.93389691622025 and lat=49.79895823510417, define the buffer as 10000 meters (10 km) and the closeness value as 1

hike4u_overview(9.93389691622025, 49.79895823510417, 10000, 1)
```


**Running this example will print the following text in your console:**

**Example code:**
``` r
library(hike4u)

# Define your location with long=9.93389691622025 and lat=49.79895823510417, define the buffer as 10000 meters (10 km) and the closeness value as 1

hike4u_satellite(9.93389691622025, 49.79895823510417, 10000, 1)
```

## Functions

The following functions are part of the `hike4u` package:

`get_number_routes`: _(longitude, latitude, buffer)_ - Returns the number of hiking routes in the buffer area around your location.

`hike4u_ov`: _(longitude, latitude, buffer, closeness_value)_ - Plots a hiking route near your location as an overview map.

`hike4u_sat`: _(longitude, latitude, buffer, closeness_value)_ - Plots a hiking route near your location as a satellite map.


**Run with example data:**

`merge_mls`: _(sf_df, column)_ - Merges multiple MultiLineStrings in a data frame into one MultiLineString.

`squ_bbox`: _(sf_df, column, value, increase)_ - Creates a bigger square bounding box of an sf object than sf::st_bbox.

`squ_bbox_pol`: _(sf_df, column, value, increase)_ - Creates a bigger square polygon around an af object than sf::st_bbox.

`add_start_points`: 

`calculate_closeness`: 

`calculate_ext`: 

`get_hiking_routes`: 

`plot_overview_map`: 

`plot_satellite_map`:
